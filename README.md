This project is a simple survey form created to collect user information through various input fields. It includes sections for name, email, age, preferred contact method, additional options like subscribing to newsletters, and a space for comments. The form uses basic HTML elements such as text inputs, email validation, a dropdown menu, radio buttons for contact method, and checkboxes for additional preferences.

The purpose of this project is to practice structuring a form with different types of inputs, ensuring a user-friendly experience. It's a great example of creating interactive web forms with clear labeling and validation to collect data from users effectively.
